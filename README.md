# Multivariate-Multistep-Wind-Speed-Prediction

This respiratory contains the implementation codes of of both single-step and multi-step wind speed prediction using multivariate input data. The idea was to used exogenous parameters (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure, ... , etc) to predict the wind speed for different horizons (steps ahead) without involving the history data of wind speed itself. Two main approaches were used including various deep learning transfer learning methods and the conventional neural networks models.
